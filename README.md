# LunaMech (Luna for short)

LunaMech is a featureful and modular Bot to be used for general administration with
Matrix server. LunaMech started as a way to create large private communities that are
invite only as Matrix in its current form doesn't have anything similar to 'guilds'
on Discord, so LunaMech has been built around the idea of communities. Because of the
idea of creating "communities" using LunaMech, commands are prefixed with community
names and commands that start with community names only impact that community.
